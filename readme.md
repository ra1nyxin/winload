> A lightweight, real-time CLI tool for monitoring network bandwidth and traffic, inspired by Linux's nload.

## 🚀 Introduction
Winload brings an intuitive, visual network monitor to the modern terminal. It started as a Windows-focused tool to fill the nload gap, and now targets Linux and macOS as well.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
Winload is inspired by the classic nload project by Roland Riegel. Many thanks for the original idea and experience.
